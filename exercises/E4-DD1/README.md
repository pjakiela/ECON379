## Empirical Exercise 4  

This is the empirical exercise associated with our first module on difference-in-differences estimation. 
In this exercise, we're going to analyze data from Ignaz Semmelweis' handwashing 
intervention in the maternity hospital in Vienna.  The data come from 
Semmelweis' (1861) book, and some helpful person put them on Wikipedia. 
We'll be reading them in from excel using the import excel command.  

To get started, create a folder for this exercise, download [the Semmelweis data](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E4-DD1/Semmelweis1861data.dta), and 
save it in your folder.  

We'll be making graphs, so you should also install Stata's `blindschemes` package if you have not already done so. 
To do this, use the `findit` command by typing:
```
findit blindschemes
```
A window will open that looks like this: 
![blindshemes-window]()
