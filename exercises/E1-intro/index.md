## Module 1: Why Evaluate?  

### Empirical Exercise

This exercise makes use of the data set `E1-CohenEtAl-data.dta`, 
a subset of the data used in the paper [Price Subsidies, 
Diagnostic Tests, and Targeting of Malaria Treatment: Evidence from a 
Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130267) by Jessica Cohen, Pascaline Dupas, and Simone 
Schaner, published in the _American Economic Review_ in 2015.  

The authors examine behavioral responses to various discounts ("subsidies") 
for malaria treatment, called "artemisinin combination therapy" 
or "ACT."
