## Empirical Exercie 11

This is the first of two exercises on power calculations.  In this exercise, we'll review the concepts 
of **size** and **power** in hypothesis testing, and learn how to calculate the **minimum detectable effect** 
as a function of sample size (or the required sample size as a function of the minimum detectable effect).

#### What Is a Research Design?

Every research design involves:

1. A null hypothesis and either one or several alternative hypotheses
2. A statistic that we can calculate from observations of an outcome variable which is related to our hypotheses
3. A rule that maps possible values of the statistic into decisions about whether to reject the null hypothesis

**Example 1**  
We want to test the null hypothesis that a coin is "fair" (equally likely to land on heads or tails).  Our 
statistic is the percentage of the time the coin lands on heads in 2 tosses.  What are some possible rules we 
might use to tell us when to reject the null hypothesis?
