# Empirical Exercise 2

In this exercise, we'll use Stata's `rnormal()` command to generate draws from a normally-distributed random variable.  This approach - simulating data according to a known data-generating process - is an incredibly useful tool 
in empirical microeconomics (both for checking your econometric intuitions and your anlayis code).  

We'll use "locals" (also know as "local macros") to easily change the number of observations and other parameters of our data set.  This will allow us to explore the way the properties of randomly-assigned treatment groups in 
larger and smaller samples.
