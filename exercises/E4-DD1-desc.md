# Empirical Exercise 4  

This is the empirical exercise associated with our first module on difference-in-differences estimation. 
In this exercise, we're going to analyze data from Ignaz Semmelweis' handwashing 
intervention in the maternity hospital in Vienna.  The data come from 
Semmelweis' (1861) book, and some helpful person put them on Wikipedia. 
We'll be reading them in from excel using the import excel command.
