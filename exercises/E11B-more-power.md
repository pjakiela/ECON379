## Empirical Exercise 11, Part 2

This is the second of two exercises on power calculations. In this exercise, we'll review the concepts of size and power 
in hypothesis testing, and learn how to calculate the **minimum detectable effect** as a function of sample size 
(or the required sample size as a function of the minimum detectable effect).
