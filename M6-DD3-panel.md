## Diff-in-Diff in Panel Data

<br>

### Overview  
This is our third module on difference-in-differences estimation.  We discuss a range of approaches to testing the common trends assumption, and introduce the event study 
framework for estimating treatment effects that evolve over time.  

_This module contains 38 minutes of video lecture.  There are currently no readings or empirical exercises for this module._

  <ol>
  <li>What is the event study approach, and how can it be used to evaluate the impacts of a program?</li>
  <li>When might it make sense to use an event study approach rather than a simple 2X2 differences-in-differences estimation strategy?</li>
  <li>How would you implement the event study approach?</li>
  <li>How can you use the event study approach to test the common trends assumption?<li>
  <li>What other hypothesis tests might you run after an event study?  How might they be implemented?</li>
