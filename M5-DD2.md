## Diff-in-Diff in a Regression Framework

<br>

### Overview  
This is the first of three modules on regression approaches to difference-in-differences estimation.  In this module, we review the basic two-by-two difference-in-differences regression specification, and discuss extensions that allow for continuous variation in treatent intensity and the inclusion of period-specific fixed effects.

  <ol>
  <li>What are traditional birth attendants?  Why did the government of Malawi decide to ban them? </li>
  <li>What data set(s) do Professor Godlonton and Dr. Okeke use to estimate the impact of Malawi's ban on traditional birth attendants?</li>
  <li>What is there identification strategy?  What is the treatment group?  Who or what is the treatment group compared to?</li>
  <li>What alternatives to traditional birth attendants are available to expectant mothers in Malawi?</li>
  <li>What are the impacts of Malawi's ban on traditional birth attendants?  Does the ban lead to a decline in the use of TBAs?  An increase in the use of skilled birth attendants? What other impacts do the authors report?</li>
    <li>Did Malawi's ban on traditional birth attendants reduce neonatal mortality?</li>

  <ol>
  <li>When you estimate a simple 2X2 difference-in-differences specification in a regression framework, what are the three independent variables?  How do we interpret each of the coefficients?</li>
