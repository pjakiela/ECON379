## Module 1: Why Evaluate?  

<br>

### Overview  
This module introduces the concept of **impact evaluation** and discusses the ways that impact evaluation is different from other monitoring and evaluation activities.  The video lecture provides an introduction to the use of randomized trials in the evaluation of anti-poverty interventions.  The empirical exercise is a gentle Stata warm-up.  

_This module contains one reading, a video (guest) lecture (approximately 15 minutes), slides for in-class discussion, and an empirical exercise._

### Empirical Exercise
This exercise makes use of the data set [E1-CohenEtAl-data.dta](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E1-intro/E1-CohenEtAl-data.dta), a subset of the data used in the paper [Price Subsidies, Diagnostic Tests, and Targeting of Malaria Treatment: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130267) by Jessica Cohen, Pascaline Dupas, and Simone Schaner, published in the _American Economic Review_ in 2015.  The authors examine behavioral responses to various discounts ("subsidies") for malaria treatment, called "artemisinin combination therapy" or "ACT."

The aim of this empirical exercise is to review key Stata commands.  You can download the activity as a [do file](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E1-intro/E1-questions.do) or a [pdf](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E1-intro/E1-questions.pdf).  There is a web page for the exercise [here](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E1-intro).
