## Module 4: Difference-in-Differences Estimation

<br>

### Overview  
This module introduces the **difference-in-differences** identification strategy.  We review the basic setup and assumptions necessary for the diff-in-diff estimator to provide a valid estimate of causal impacts.  We also survey some of the seminal early applications of diff-in-diff estimation to social policy.   

_This module includes one reading, four video lectures (approximately 62 minutes total), and an empirical exercise._
