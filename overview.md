### Why Stata and Nor R?
Many quantitative social scientists have strong feelings about the relative merits of Stata and R.  If 
you are interested in doing empirical microeconomics after you graduate, you should learn (at least a little bit of) both.  You don't 
have to be an expert in both, but you should be able to open up a data set, make a graph, and run a regression.  

R has capabilities that Stata does not have:  for example, several machine learning tools are only available in R, and 
their are better tools for creating dynamic visualizations.  Stata also has advantages, the most prosaic of which is that 
it is the statistical software used by the overwhelming majority of economists over 40 - including most of the people that might 
hire you as an RA after graduation.
