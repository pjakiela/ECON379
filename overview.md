### Why Stata and Nor R?
Many quantitative social scientists have strong feelings about the relative merits of Stata and R.  If 
you are interested in doing empirical microeconomics after you graduate, you should learn (at least a little bit of) both - you should at least be able to open up a data set, make a graph, and run a regression.  

Stata and R both have advantages and disadvantages.  Most importantly (for you), 
there are people who might hire you after graduation who only want to hire people who know R (many people in industry, political scientists, young hipsters), 
and there are people who might hire you after graduation who only want to hire people who know Stata (economists over 45).  Anyone hiring you for a technical position 
will want to see evidence that you can learn new technologigal tools, so knowing both Stata and R is not going to hurt you.  Learn some of both, 
and decide which one you prefer once you are the boss.
