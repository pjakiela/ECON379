## Module 3: False Counterfactuals

<br>

### Overview  
This module reviews the weaknesses of the two **false counterfactual** identification strategies:  pre vs. post designs and participant vs. non-participant comparisons.  We review these issues through a case study of the Millennium Villages Project.

_This module contains 29 minutes of video lecture and three reading assignments (one of which includes a paper and two subsequent comments)._

  <li>How can we describe the causal impact of a program in terms of potential outcomes with and without treatment? </li>
  <li>What is a counterfactual? </li>
  <li>In what ways (three) must a valid comparison group be similar to the treatment group? </li>
  <li>What is an intent-to-treat estimate of a program's impact, and how does it differ from a treatment-on-the-treated estimate? </li>
  <li>What are the two false (or "counterfeit") counterfactuals, and what is the source of bias associated with each one? </li>
  </ol>

3.2 The Millennium Villages evaluation and subsequent commentary  

[The effect of an integrated multisector model for achieving the Millennium Development Goals and improving child survival in rural sub-Saharan Africa: a non-randomised controlled assessment](http://wordpress.ei.columbia.edu/mdg-east/files/2013/02/Millennium-Villages-child-mortality-Lancet-2012.pdf)  

Note:  the link _should_ take you to the original published version; the [version available on the Lancet website](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673612602074) is corrected.  You'll know you are reading the original version if the last sentence of the abstract section titled **Findings** is: "The average annual rate of reduction of mortality in children younger than 5 years of age was three-times faster in Millennium Village sites than in the most recent 10-year national rural trends (7.8% vs 2.5%).  The original version is also posted on glow (Williams students only).
