## Module 3: False Counterfactuals

<br>

### Overview  
This module reviews the weaknesses of the two **false counterfactual** identification strategies:  pre vs. post designs and participant vs. non-participant comparisons.  We review these issues through a case study of the Millennium Villages Project.

3.1 The Millennium Villages evaluation and subsequent commentary

Note:  the link _should_ take you to the original published version; the [version available on the Lancet website](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673612602074) is corrected.  You'll know you are reading the original version if the last sentence of the abstract section titled **Findings** is: "The average annual rate of reduction of mortality in children younger than 5 years of age was three-times faster in Millennium Village sites than in the most recent 10-year national rural trends (7.8% vs 2.5%).  The original version is also posted on glow (Williams students only).
