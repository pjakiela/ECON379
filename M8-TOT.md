<br>

### Overview  
In this module, we learn how we can use two-stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the local average treatment effect of a program under imperfect compliance.

  <ol>
    <li>What is an intent-to-treat estimate, and how does it differ from an estimate of the impact of treatment-on-the-treated?</li>
    <li>What is a local average treatment effect?</li>
    <li>What does imperfect compliance mean?  Who are the compliers?  Other than the compliers, what other groups might we expect to find in our impact evaluation sample?</li>
    <li>How can we construct an estimate of the impact of treatment-on-the-treated?</li>
    <li>What is randomized promotion?  What three conditions must be satisfied for the randomized promotion approach to provide a valid estimate of program impacts?</li>
