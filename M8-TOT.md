## Impacts of Treatment-on-the-Treated

<br>

### Overview  
In this module, we learn how we can use two-stage least squares (2SLS) to estimate the local average treatment effect of a program under imperfect compliance.  

_This module contains one reading, a set of slides for in-class discussion, and an empirical exercise._

  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>What is an intent-to-treat estimate, and how does it differ from an estimate of the impact of treatment-on-the-treated?</li>
    <li>What is a local average treatment effect?</li>
    <li>What does imperfect compliance mean?  Who are the compliers?  Other than the compliers, what other groups might we expect to find in our impact evaluation sample?</li>
    <li>How can we construct an estimate of the impact of treatment-on-the-treated?</li>
    <li>What is randomized promotion?  What three conditions must be satisfied for the randomized promotion approach to provide a valid estimate of program impacts?</li>
  </ol>

### Empirical Exercise
[Empirical Exercise 8](https://pjakiela.github.io/ECON379/exercises/E8-TOT.html)  
In this exercise, we’ll be using data from the paper [The Miracle of Microfinance? Evidence from a Randomized Evaluation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43189512?seq=1) by Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo, Rachel Glennerster, and Cynthia Kinnan. The paper reports the results of one of the first randomized evaluations of a microcredit intervention. We’ll be using a small slice of the data from their paper to explore the use of instrumental variables techniques to estimate impacts of treatment on the treated - and to think about when such methods are appropriate.
