		\item Some human development outcomes have improved since 1960:  life expectancy went up, both infant and maternal mortality declined, and educational attainment increased

Would Tanzania have been better off without aid (or with less of it)?

	\item Argentina and Mongolia only received about 6.5 billion (2013) dollars in aid

\medskip
\textbf{An ``ideal'' experiment:} \\
Suppose Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda all applied for a loan, but one got it (at random)

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item No one is going to do this, and they (probably) shouldn't
	
	\item But such an experiment might help us learn about the impacts of aid on development
	
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
\medskip
Some questions we might be able to answer:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Do microfinance loan help women start small businesses and support their families?
	
	\item What were the impacts of school construction on education and adult wages?  
	
	\item Does subsidizing malaria treatment or bednets improve child health?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Who?}

\medskip
Three types of individuals who often wish to initiate a program evaluation:

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Researchers, policymakers, donors
	
	\medskip
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Often asking different research questions
		
		\item All (policy-relevant) knowledge is (to some degee) context specific
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip
Who is interested in the results of a program evaluation?

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{What?}

\medskip
Which programs \textbf{should} be evaluated?

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Is it replicable?
	
	\item Are there opportunity costs?
	
	\item Is it innovative or untested?  Do we care about the results?
	
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\medskip
When \textbf{shouldn't} a program be evaluated?  

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item When are the opportunity costs low?
	
	\item When are the impacts of a program known?
	
	\item When is it unethical to have a comparison group?
	
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Where?}

\medskip
Program evaluation is a tool of both development and labor economics

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Randomized evaluations of social policy increasingly common in ``developed'' countries
	
	\item NGOs play an outsize role in service provision in LMICs
	
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
\medskip
Certain countries may be over-represented (e.g.~Ghana, Kenya, Malawi)

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Where is data publicly available (cf.~Demographic and Health Surveys)?
	
	\item Other countries (e.g.~India, Indonesia) are large but \textbf{not} over-represented 
	
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
\medskip
Where does aid go within countries?  Where do evaluations take place?

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Existing literature suggests aid ends up in wealthier places in poor countries
	
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{When?}

\medskip
What are the differences between \textbf{retrospective} and \textbf{prospective} program evaluation?

\pause
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item RCTs are not always prospective; quasi-experimental evaluations not always retrospective
	
	\medskip
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item \textbf{Example:}  regression discontinuity design around eligibility cutoff
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
\medskip
What are (some of) the strengths of prospective evaluation?

\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item (I'm not going to tell you the answer, but Gertler et al.~have thoughts)
	
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
\medskip
What are (some of) the (potential) weaknesses of prospective evaluation?

\pause
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item External vs.~internal validity, (short) evaluation windows
	
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item What is the treatment?  What is $X$?

	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Example:  \textbf{microfinance} (provision of small, uncollateralized loans to poor borrowers)
	
		\medskip
		\begin{itemize}
		
		\item Is the treatment a loan?  Or being offered a loan?  Or having an MFI in your neighborhood?
		
		\end{itemize}
	
	\item What is the \textbf{estimand}?  Difference treatments lead to different (expected) treatment effects
	
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pause
	\item What do we expect $X$ to impact?  What is $Y$?
	
	\medskip
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item What are the outcomes, and how can/should we measure them?
	
	\item Example:  receiving a loan, having a microenterprise, HH income, empowerment, etc.
	
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pause
	\item How can we measure causal impacts of $X$?
	
	\medskip
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item What is the \textbf{identification strategy}?  (some possible answers:  RCT, DD, IV, RD, ``HFB'')
