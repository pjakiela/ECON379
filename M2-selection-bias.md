## Selection Bias and the Experimental Ideal

<br>

### Overview  
This module introduces the **potential outcomes** framework that we'll use throughout the course as well as the concept of **selection bias** before explaining how average treatment effects can be estimated when treatment status is randomly assigned.  

_This module includes one reading, four video lectures (approximately 75 minutes total), and an empirical exercise._

### Empirical Exercise

In this exercise, we'll use Stata's `rnormal()` command to generate draws from a normally-distributed random variable.  This approach - simulating data 
according to a known data-generating process - is an incredibly useful tool in empirical microeconomics (both for checking your econometric intuitions and 
your anlayis code).    

We'll use "locals" (also know as "local macros") to easily change the number of observations and other parameters of our data set.  This will allow us to 
explore the way the properties of randomly-assigned treatment groups in larger and smaller samples.  

This exercise introduces a range of practical coding tools:  `rnormal()`, locals, and the `return list` and `display` commands.  By varying the sample size, we'll build a better understanding of the role that the Law of large Numbers plays in randomized evaluations.
