## Two-Way Fixed Effects

<br>

### Overview  
In this module, we look at the use of two-way fixed effects to estimate generalized difference-in-differences models when treatment timing varies across treated units.  We'll see 
that the mis-specification issues we discussed in the context of continuous variation in treatment are also relevant here, and that two-way fixed effects estimates can be 
severely biased when treatment is staggered and treatment effects on individual units are not constant over time. 

_This module contains 34 minutes of video lecture, one short reading, and two empirical exercises._

  <ol>
    <li>What is "staggered treatment timing" in the context of difference-in-differences estimation?  When might one try to estimate treatment 
      effects in a context where treatment timing is staggered?</li>
    <li>What is the two-way fixed effects estimator of the treatment effect?</li>
    <li>Dr. Andrew Goodman-Bacon shows that the two-way fixed effects estimator can be decomposed into a weighted average... of what?</li>
    <li>When we estimate a treatment effect via two-way fixed effects and treatment timing is staggered, which units are used a treatment and which are used as control?</li>
    <li>When is the two-way fixed effects estimator likely to provide a biased estimate of the treatment effect of a program?</li>

  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>What is the two-way fixed effects estimator of the treatment effect?  What regression would you run to arrive at this estimator?  How must your data be structured?</li>
    <li>Describe how you could translate a two-way fixed effects regression into a univariate regression (of an outcome on a single independent variable).</li>
    <li>In two-way fixed effects regression, which units are implicitly included in the treatment group and which units are implicitly treated as controls?</li>
    <li>When can we be confident that two-way fixed effects provides an unbiased estimate of the average treatment effect of a program?</li>
    <li>When should we worry that two-way fixed effects will yield a biased estimate of the treatment effect of a program?</li>
